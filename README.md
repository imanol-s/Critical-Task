# Project Dependency Scheduler
Project Dependency Scheduler is a Java-based application designed to [describe the main functionality or purpose of the project]. This repository contains the source code and necessary files to build and run the application.

# Project Dependency Scheduler
## Description
Designed and implemented a modular graph structure to model project tasks (PERT), supporting both directed and undirected graphs for flexible task dependency representation. The Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) algorithm uses a weighted average to calculate the expected time for tasks in a project
PERT charts are used to create project schedules, identify task dependencies, and find the critical path of a project. The critical path is the longest sequence of tasks that determines the shortest time to complete the project. 

## Features
- Developed an algorithm for Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) to analyze task dependencies, calculate earliest/latest start times, and identify critical paths for efficient project scheduling.
- Built a driver application to read graph inputs, execute the PERT algorithm, and output project scheduling results, ensuring seamless integration and usability.
- Demonstrated strong problem-solving and algorithmic design skills by optimizing project timelines and resource allocation through graph manipulation and critical path analysis.
