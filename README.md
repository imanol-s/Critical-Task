# Project Dependency Scheduler (PERT)

## Description
Designed and implemented a modular graph structure to model project tasks (PERT), supporting both directed and undirected graphs for flexible task dependency representation. The Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) algorithm uses a weighted average to calculate the expected time for tasks in a project

## Features
- Developed an algorithm for Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) to analyze task dependencies, calculate earliest/latest start times, and identify critical paths for efficient project scheduling.
- Built a driver application to read graph inputs, execute the PERT algorithm, and output project scheduling results, ensuring seamless integration and usability.
- Demonstrated strong problem-solving and algorithmic design skills by optimizing project timelines and resource allocation through graph manipulation and critical path analysis.

## Future Development
- Full UI
